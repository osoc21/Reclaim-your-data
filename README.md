# WePod Photo Web Application
The WePod Photo Web Application enables you to get back control over your photos that are stored in your very own [Solid pod](https://signup.pod.inrupt.com/). The project is the result of a partnership between [IDLab](https://idlab.technology/) and [Open Summer of Code](https://osoc.be/) (OSOC21), an initiative of [Open Knowledge Belgium](https://openknowledge.be/). OSOC is a 4-week program during the month of July, where students from all kinds of different backgrounds join together to work on awesome open source projects and make a positive impact on society.

# Tech Stack
The project was made in [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) with the [Inrupt JavaScript client libraries](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/). However, you might also want to check out Inrupt's [Solid React SDK](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/react-sdk/).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up the application locally

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and NPM are needed to run the application locally. Make sure to have an updated version installed (Node v14 or greater, npm v6 or greater).

Once these are installed, change directory to the project directory `Reclaim your data`.

Here, execute:

> `npm install` 

and wait for the command to finish.

## Running the application locally

To run the application locally, execute:

> `npm start`

This launches the application in your default web browser at the following address: `localhost:3000`.

Once launched, you can log in with your pod provider (only [Inrupt.com](https://podbrowser.inrupt.com/login) is supported at this time) and access your pod.

*Note:* The page will automatically reload if you make edits in the code and print any lint errors to the console.
